ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Morris,

i'm an early stage tech investor at day and software developer at night. I work as a Partner at [Lunar Ventures](https://lunar.vc) where I've invested in companies such as [Hathora](https://hathora.dev), [Flipt](https://flipt.io), [Deep-Ivy](https://lets-unify.ai), [Electric SQL](https://electric-sql.com) and [Instill (VDP)](https://instill.tech). 
I love working with technology/open-source founders on building things that make a difference. 

Where can I help?
- Tech & Product strategy.
- Early GTM strategy (open-source, produc-led, bottom-up).
- Early talent vetting.
- Fund-raising support and strategy.
- Pre-seed and seed stage investments.
